## Hi, my name is Cameron 
# I have always dreamed of learning how to code. 
# It began with a love for computers and technology in general from a very young age!
# I love the fact that I grew up in the Age of Information, and am never not excited to see the advances in both software and hardware that are constantly being made. 
# Im determined to verse myself and become a developer so that I may contribute to the digital world and maybe create something that others may enjoy! 
# Thank you for reading my README.MD !!!
